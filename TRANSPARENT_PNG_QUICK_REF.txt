                  TRANSPARENT PNG - QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================

TRANSPARENCY SUPPORT
--------------------
✓ Full alpha channel support (0-255 transparency)
✓ Double-sided rendering (visible from both sides)
✓ Proper alpha blending (smooth edges)
✓ Works in billboard mode
✓ Saves and loads correctly


HOW TO USE
----------
1. Create or obtain PNG file with transparent background
2. Press 'A' to open Animation UI
3. Drag and drop PNG file(s) onto window
4. Plane created automatically with transparency
5. Done! Transparent areas will be see-through


CREATING TRANSPARENT PNGS
--------------------------
Software Options:
  - Photoshop: Save as PNG-24 or PNG-32
  - GIMP: Export as PNG with alpha channel
  - Paint.NET: Save as PNG (auto includes alpha)
  - Online: Use remove.bg to remove backgrounds

Requirements:
  - Must be PNG format (not JPG!)
  - Must have alpha channel
  - RGB or RGBA color mode


QUICK EXAMPLES
--------------

Character Sprite:
  1. Drag character_01.png, character_02.png
  2. Check "Billboard" in Animation UI
  3. Adjust frame time for animation
  4. Position in scene

Floating Icon:
  1. Drag icon.png (with transparency)
  2. Check "Billboard"
  3. Set size to 2x2 for smaller icon
  4. Position above object

Transparent Overlay:
  1. Create semi-transparent PNG in editor
  2. Drag into application
  3. Uncheck "Billboard" for fixed orientation
  4. Resize and position


TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------
Blend Mode: BLEND_ALPHA (automatic)
Backface Culling: Disabled (see both sides)
Depth Testing: Enabled (proper Z-order)
Color Multiplier: White (preserves original colors)


KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
------------------
A       : Toggle Animation UI
CTRL+S  : Save (preserves transparency)
CTRL+L  : Load (restores transparency)
ESC     : Deselect plane


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

PNG Not Transparent?
  → Check PNG has alpha channel in image editor
  → Re-export with transparency enabled
  → Use PNG-24 or PNG-32 format

Black Halo Around Edges?
  → PNG has black background under alpha
  → Re-export with transparent/white background
  → Use "defringe" tool in image editor

Jagged Edges?
  → Use higher resolution PNG (2x or 4x size)
  → Enable anti-aliasing when creating PNG
  → Smooth alpha channel edges

Can Only See One Side?
  → Code auto-disables backface culling
  → Both sides should be visible
  → Check camera position


PERFORMANCE TIPS
----------------
Recommended Sizes:
  - Small icons: 128x128 to 256x256
  - Character sprites: 512x512 to 1024x1024
  - Large overlays: 1024x1024 to 2048x2048
  - Maximum: 4096x4096 (GPU dependent)

Optimization:
  - Trim excess transparent space
  - Use smallest size that looks good
  - Compress with PNG optimization tools
  - Keep frame count reasonable


SAVING & LOADING
----------------
✓ Transparency preserved when saving (CTRL+S)
✓ PNG paths saved in .dat file
✓ Textures reloaded on load (CTRL+L)
✓ Alpha channel automatically restored
✓ Keep PNG files at original paths!


BEST PRACTICES
--------------
1. Use descriptive filenames (char_walk_01.png)
2. Keep all animation frames same size
3. Store PNGs in project folder
4. Test transparency before importing
5. Create planes back-to-front for proper overlap
6. Use billboard mode for camera-facing sprites
7. Adjust frame timing for smooth animation


SUPPORTED FORMATS
-----------------
PNG  : Full alpha support ✓
JPG  : No transparency (opaque)
BMP  : No transparency (opaque)
TGA  : May work (untested)


COMMON USES
-----------
✓ Character sprites and animations
✓ UI elements in 3D space (health bars, markers)
✓ Particle effects (fire, smoke, explosions)
✓ Decals and overlays (signs, posters)
✓ Transparent windows/glass effects
✓ Icons and indicators
✓ Special effects and highlights


VERIFICATION
------------
After adding transparent PNG, check:
  □ Transparent areas are see-through
  □ Colors look correct (not too dark)
  □ No black/white halo around edges
  □ Visible from both front and back
  □ Smooth edges (no jaggedness)
  □ Animation plays smoothly (if multiple frames)


EXAMPLE WORKFLOW
----------------
1. Create sprite sheet in Photoshop
2. Export frames as separate PNGs with transparency
3. Name files: sprite_01.png, sprite_02.png, etc.
4. Launch application
5. Press 'A' to open Animation UI
6. Drag all PNG files onto window
7. Enable "Billboard" mode
8. Set frame time to 0.1 seconds
9. Position sprite in scene
10. Press CTRL+S to save
11. Sprite with transparency preserved!


FAQ
---
Q: Do I need special settings for transparency?
A: No! Just use PNG files with alpha. It works automatically.

Q: Can I use semi-transparent PNGs?
A: Yes! All alpha values (0-255) are supported.

Q: Does transparency work in billboard mode?
A: Yes! Perfect for camera-facing sprites.

Q: Will planes work after saving and loading?
A: Yes! Transparency is fully preserved.

Q: Can I see the plane from both sides?
A: Yes! Both front and back faces are rendered.
